                    <p>Considering the fact that even small plumbing leaks can waste <b>100,000 gallons of water</b>, getting regular plumbing services is pretty important. Otherwise, you could wind up wasting tons of extra money on your water bill!</p>                    
                    <br>
                    <p>Before you start looking for a “drain cleaning service near me” however, there are a few things you need to know. That way, you’ll be able to find the best plumbing service and know exactly what to expect.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So, are you ready to put a pause on your Google search for “best plumbing service” and learn about what that actually entails? Let’s check it out.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Types of Drain Cleaning <span>Services</span></h2>
                    <p>There’s more than one type of draining cleaning service out there, and knowing the differences can help you find the right one for your needs. Let’s check out two of the most common methods.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Cabling</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cabling, sometimes called snaking, is a system in which a plumber places a long, flexible auger down your pipes. These augers then dislodge any blockages in your drains.
                        <br>
                        You can actually purchase drain cables on your own at most local hardware stores. However, without the knowledge of a professional, you can damage your pipes if you’re not careful.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Hydro Jetting</h3>
                    <p>Hydro-jetting blasts high-pressure water down your pipes to help remove dirt and debris. The blasts of water dislodge dirt in the plumbing system and push them down the drain and out of the pipes.</p>
                    <p>Hydro-jetting is an extremely powerful system that can blast away years of buildup. However, you’ll need a specialized hose to use this method as well as a plumbing camera to look for damage, making it a method that’s only appropriate for <b>professional plumbers.</b></p>

                    <br>
                    <h2>How to Tell If You Need Drain Cleaning <span>Services</span></h2>
                    <p>Now that you know what the different drain cleaning options are, let’s talk about how to tell if you need one of them. Sometimes, it can be easier to tell than others.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Slow Draining Sinks</h3>
                    <p>We’ve all been there – we wash our hands, turn off the tap, and… the water stays in the sink. When this happens, there’s usually a blockage somewhere in your pipes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you have a slow draining sink, you might want to call a plumber. Or, call if you notice the water draining but gurgling as it goes down.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <h3>Toilet Overflows</h3>
                    <p>Are you constantly dealing with toilet clogs? Do you feel as though you’re frequently <b>fixing toilet overflows?</b></p>
                    <p>You may be struggling with drain issues. When toilets continually backup or overflow, it’s usually due to drainage issues. Getting in touch with a professional can help you put a stop to this.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Water Backing Up</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever noticed that the bathtub or the <b>bathroom sink</b> is full of water? If so, there’s a high likelihood that you’re dealing with a clog somewhere in your drain.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>Bad Smells</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes all you need to know whether or not there’s a draining issue is your nose. If you notice any bad smells emanating from your drains, you’ve probably got a clog somewhere.</p>
                    <p>The most common source of bad smells in your drains is food and grease buildup. If you notice these smells, give a plumber a call to address the drainage issue right away.</p>

                    <br>
                    <h2>How Long Does Drain Cleaning <span>Take?</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        If your hesitation to pick up the phone and call a professional is due to time constraints, we can put your mind at ease. Drain cleaning services don’t actually take very long and, in fact, usually only require a couple of hours to complete.
                        <br>
                        What that means is that you can usually schedule drain cleaning services when you have 2-3 hours of free time. And, if you’re working with us, we’ll work with your schedule to make sure we get the job done at a convenient time for you.

                    <br>
                    <h2>How Much Does Drain Cleaning <span>Cost?</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        The million-dollar question is, of course, how much drain cleaning costs. Now, while drain cleaning costs will vary depending on the company, the issue, and your location, there are a few average prices you can expect to pay.
                        <br>
                        Across the USA, most drain cleaning professionals will charge somewhere between $130 and $180 to get the job done. However, you can find teams that will offer flat rates as low as $50.
                        <br>
                        Keep in mind that some plumbers charge hourly rates while others charge fixed rates. You’ll need to get an estimate from your chosen service professional to make sure you know which you’re getting into.
                        <br>
                        It’s also important to be aware that sometimes plumbers may find additional issues with your plumbing when they clean your drain. Although you don’t have to take them up on their services, this can add additional costs to your quotes.
                        <br>
                        Lastly, you can always DIY your own drain cleaning for a few bucks. However, this can end up being much more costly than working with professionals if you damage your pipes and need costly repairs.
                    </p>
